## Interactive dashboard using plotly , dash , bootstrap, and python for the Data visualization course on "Looks VS. Personality Dataset".
This dashboard shows the percentage of which characteristic is more important not only looks and personality but many other characteristics for women and men of different nationalities.
We found men favor looks, but women favor personality. And we made a survey to know if men and women think as same or not nowadays. But we found they still thinking in the same way.
